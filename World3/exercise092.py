# Objective: Make a program that read the name, birth year and the CTPS and storage them (with the age) in a dictionary.abs
# If the CTPS was different by ZERO, the dictionary will receive the hire year and the income.
# Calculate and add, besides the age, how many years the person will retire. (with 35 years the person retire)

# Programmer: Hugo Le√ßa Ribeiro
